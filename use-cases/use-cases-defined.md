### 2. Generate City Population Report
- **Primary Actor**: Data Analyst
- **Goal**: Retrieve a list of cities organized by population size, with options to filter by continent, country, district, or world.
- **Trigger**: The analyst selects a city report type.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. The analyst chooses the report filter (e.g., by country, by district, top N cities).
  2. The system retrieves city data based on the selected filter.
